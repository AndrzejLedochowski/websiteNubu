        Hi, my name is Nubu The King. Very curiouse and world wonder creature. I'm well traveled and educated
        individual. Have experience in variaty of jobs and professions.
        I've worked as a barman and in browery as a instoller of pumps to pour a beer, I've been a teacher,
        swimming instructor and physioterapist. I dirty ma hands on building site as a labour and have been
        selling suits in shopping centre.
        I experiance sharpness of mind of university students and obtuseness of those who don't appreciate
        knowladge.

        Visiting places, exploring cities, talking to people gave me a brief view and idea how various and
        divers world could be.
        It is fascinating to know that diference doesn't mean less valuable. I don't like != that bad.

    <h3>
        My interest in technology and coding

    </h3>
    <p>My first computer/laptop I got when I was 34. I remeber exactly, tah was TOSHIBA with 32Gb of HDD. What a
        joyful day that was.
        I was happy like a child over Xmas. Didn't take very long when I realise technology is progressing with
        a "speed of light" and soon my mobile phone had much more memory and been working faster then computer.
        That was a moment when started seriously thimk about changing industry and profession. At the moment, we
        have March 2019 I'm half way down to get apprenticeship in coding/software development in well known
        company.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Adventure with Code Nation
    </h3>

    <p>Only way to make my transition from one industry to another possible was to get scholarship. Where I'll
        be paid from a day one.
        Code Nation is a place where dream could come true. Unusual approach to teaching and to business itself
        allowes those in similar sytuation to mine, have a chance to completely transformate their lives.
        Here in CN dreams come true.

    <h1> HERE IS A FEW THINKS I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU</h1>


    <h3>
        <p>The purpose of an IT in modern business</p>
    </h3>
    <div>
        <li>Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan. From
            multi-national corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses
            that own a single computer, IT plays a role. The reasons for the omnipresent use of computer
            technology in business can best be determined by looking at how it is being used across the
            business world.</li>
    </div>



    <div>
        <p>Communication Between Employees, Suppliers and Customers</p>
        For many companies, email is the principal means of communication between employees, suppliers
        and customers. Email was one of the early drivers of the Internet, providing a simple and
        inexpensive means to communicate. Over the years, a number of other communications tools have
        also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, online meeting tools and
        video-conferencing systems. Voice over internet protocol (VOIP) telephones and smart-phones
        offer even more high-tech ways for employees to communicate.
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Inventory Management Systems</p>
        When it comes to managing inventory, organizations need to maintain enough stock to meet demand
        without investing in more than they require. Inventory management systems track the quantity of
        each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall
        below a pre-determined amount. These systems are best used when the inventory management system
        is connected to the point-of-sale (POS) system. The POS system ensures that each time an item is
        sold, one of that item is removed from the inventory count, creating a closed information loop
        between all departments.
    </div>



    <div>
        <p>Data Management Systems</p>
        The days of large file rooms, rows of filing cabinets and the mailing of documents is fading
        fast. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices.
        These documents become instantly available to everyone in the company, regardless of their
        geographical location. Companies are able to store and maintain a tremendous amount of
        historical data economically, and employees benefit from immediate access to the documents they
        need.
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Management Information Systems</p>
        Storing data is only a benefit if that data can be used effectively. Progressive companies use
        that data as part of their strategic planning process as well as the tactical execution of that
        strategy. Management Information Systems (MIS) enable companies to track sales data, expenses
        and productivity levels. The information can be used to track profitability over time, maximize
        return on investment and identify areas of improvement.
    </div>

    Managers can track sales on a daily basis, allowing them to immediately react to
    lower-than-expected numbers by boosting employee productivity or reducing the cost of an item.

    <div>
        <p>Customer Relationship Management</p>
        Companies are using IT to improve the way they design and manage customer relationships.
        Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems capture every interaction a company has with a
        customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible. If a customer calls a call center
        with an issue, the customer support representative will be able to see what the customer has
        purchased, view shipping information, call up the training manual for that item and effectively
        respond to the issue.

        The entire interaction is stored in the CRM system, ready to be recalled if the customer calls
        again. The customer has a better, more focused experience and the company benefits from improved
        productivity.

                    <h3>Selecting and using correct IT systems and software</h3>
                </li>



                <li><b>Software Overview</b></li>

                <li>
                    <h5>Computer hardware is virtually useless without computer software. Software is the
                        programs that are needed to accomplish the input, processing, output, storage, and
                        control activities of information systems.

                        Computer software is typically classified into two major types of programs: system
                        software and application software.</h5>
                </li>

                </h3>System Software</h>

                Systems software are programs that manage the resources of the computer system and
                simplify applications programming. They include software such as the operating system,
                database management systems, networking software, translators, and software utilities.

                <li><b>Application Software</b></li>

                Application software are programs that direct the performance of a particular use, or
                application, of computers to meet the information processing needs of end users. They
                include Aoff-the-shelf@ software such as word processing and spreadsheet packages, as
                well as internally or externally developed software that is designed to meet the
                specific needs of an organization.

                Software trends have been away from custom-designed one-of-kind programs developed by
                the professional programmers or end users of an organization toward the use of
                Aoff-the-shelf@ software packages acquired by end users from software vendors.

                <li><b>Two types of packages are available:</b></li>

                1. Vertical packages - assist users within a specific industry segment. Examples include
                packages that help to manage construction projects, keep track of inventory of
                hospitals, or fast-food outlets.

                2. Horizontal packages - can perform a certain general function, such as accounting, or
                office automation, for a range of businesses.

                Relationships between Hardware and Software Components

                <li><b> Operating Systems</b></li>

                The most important system software package for any computer is its operating system.
                Every computer system runs under the control of an operating system. Operating systems
                for computers that are shared by many users are considerably more complex than operating
                systems for personal computers.

                <li><b>What Does an Operating System Do?</b></li>

                The operating system is the software that controls all the resources of a computer
                system. For example it:

                1. Assigns the needed hardware to programs

                2. Schedules programs for execution on the processor

                3. Allocates the memory required for each program

                4. Assigns the necessary input and output devices

                5. Manages the data and program files stored in secondary storage

                6. Maintains file directories and provides access to the data in the files

                7. Interacts with the users



                Multiprogramming is the capacity of a computer to executing several programs
                concurrently on the same processor by having one of the programs using the processor
                while others are performing input or output.

                Multiprogramming requires that the active parts of the programs competing for the
                processor be available in main memory. Virtual memory is the seemingly expanded capacity
                of the main memory of the computer, and achieved by keeping in the main memory only the
                immediately needed parts of programs, with the complete programs kept in secondary
                storage.

                <li><b> Modes of Computer System Operation</b></li>

                Operating systems enable the system they manage to operate in various modes. These
                include batch processing, time sharing, and real-time processing.

                Batch processing Processing programs or transactions in batches, without a user's
                interaction.

                Time Sharing Systems providing interactive processing by allocating a short time slice
                for the use of the server to each user in turn.

                Real-time Processing Systems that respond to an event within a fixed time interval; used
                for example, in manufacturing plants or to collect data from several pieces of equipment
                in a laboratory.

                With the move toward multiprocessors, in which several (or even many) processors are
                configured in a single computer system, multiprocessing operating systems have been
                designed to allocate the work to the multiple processors. These systems also support
                multiprogramming, which allows many programs to compete for the processors.

                <li><b>Operating Systems for Personal Computers</b></li>

                The operating systems of personal computers which are dedicated to a single user are
                vastly simpler than the operating systems running larger machines, to which hundreds or
                thousands of users may have simultaneous access. One important capability an operating
                system can offer in a personal computing environment is multitasking: the ability to run
                several tasks at once on behalf of a user.

                The most popular microcomputer operating systems are:

                Windows 10 - Windows Vista is an advanced operating system

                - graphical user interface

                - true multitasking

                - network capabilities

                - multimedia

                DOS - is an older operating system which was used on microcomputers

                - is a single user, single-tasking operating system

                - can add a GUI interface and multitasking capabilities by using an operating
                environment such as Microsoft Windows

                OS/2 Warp - graphical user interface

                - multitasking

                - virtual memory capabilities

                - telecommunications capabilities

                Windows NT - multitasking network operating system

                - multiuser network operating system

                - installed on network servers to manage local area networks with high-performance
                computing requirements

                UNIX - popular operating system that is available for micros, minis, and mainframe
                computer systems

                - multitasking and multiuser system

                - installs on network servers

                iOS - multitasking

                - virtual memory capabilities

                - graphical user interface

                User Interface

                A user interface is a combination of means by which a user interacts with the computer
                system. It allows the end user to communicate with the operating system so they can load
                programs, access files, and accomplish other tasks. The three main types of user
                interfaces are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Command drive</li>

                    <li>Menu drive</li>

                    <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
                </ol>


                The most popular graphical user interface is that provided by Windows 95. The Windows
                environment has become a standard platform for computers.

                The Goal of Open Systems

                A drive is to use open systems in organizational computing, so that the software and
                hardware of any vendor can operate with those of any other, calls for an operating
                system that would run on any hardware platform. The term Aopen system@ is used as the
                opposite of proprietary systems of a specific manufacturer.

                In open systems, organizations want portability, scalability, and interoperability of
                applications software.

                Portable application: can be moved from one computer system to another.

                Scalable application: is one that can be moved without significant reprogramming.

                Interoperability: means that machines of various vendors and capabilities can work
                together to produce needed information.

                <li><b>Personal Productivity Software</b></li>

                Personal productivity software is the most common applications software. Run on personal
                computers, these programs assist the user in a certain range of tasks. Taken together
                with professional support systems and systems supporting groupwork, personal
                productivity software is a potent enabler of today's knowledge work.

                <li><b>Functions of Personal Productivity Software</b></li>

                Personal productivity software enhances its user's performance on a specific range of
                common tasks. This software supports database management and analysis, authoring and
                presentation, and activity and notes tracking. All these are software applications. Data
                management is supported by database management systems, while spreadsheet software
                assists in data analysis. For the needs of authoring and presentation, users employ the
                applications software for word processing, desktop publishing, presentation, and
                multimedia authoring. Personal information management software is used to track
                activities and personal notes. Communications software enables the user to connect to a
                telecommunications network in order to exchange information with other users or systems.
                Web browsers are used to access the resources of the Internet's World Wide Web.

                <li><b>Spreadsheets</b></li>

                Electronic spreadsheet packages are programs that are used for analysis, planning, and
                modelling. They provide electronic replacement for more traditional tools such as paper
                worksheets, pencils, and calculators. In a worksheet of rows and columns are stored in
                the computer's memory and displayed on the video screen. Data and formulas are entered
                into the worksheet and the computer performs the calculations based on the formulas
                entered. A spreadsheet package can also be used as a decision support tool to perform
                what-if analysis.

                <li><b>Database Management</b></li>

                Database management packages facilitate the storage, maintenance, and utilization of
                data in a database that is shared by many users. Microcomputer DBMs enables the users
                to:
                <ol>

                    <li>Create and maintain a database</li>

                    <li>Query a database with a query language</li>

                    <li>Prepare formatted reports</li>
                </ol>

                In addition, packages offer security features, network connectivity, and the ability to
                present graphical output, as well as to perform spreadsheet-type computations.

                <li>Word Processing</li>

                Word processing packages are programs that computerize the creation, edition, and
                printing of documents by electronically processing text data. Word processing is an
                important application of office automation. Word processing is the most popular
                authoring and presentation activity. In fact, it is the most common personal computing
                application.

                <li>Desktop Publishing</li>

                Organizations use desktop publishing software to produce their own printed materials
                like newsletters, brochures, manuals, and books with several type styles, graphics, and
                colors on each page. The components required to set up a modest desktop publishing
                system include: a high-resolution display, a laser printer, desktop publishing software,
                and perhaps a scanner.

                <li>Presentation Software</li>

                The goal of presentation graphics is to provide information in a graphical form that
                helps end users and mangers understand business proposals and performance and make
                better decisions about them. It is important to note that presentation graphics does not
                replace reports and displays of numbers and text material.

                <li>Multimedia Authoring Software</li>

                Multimedia authoring software enables its users to design multimedia presentations.
                Using these packages, you can develop attractive computer-based training (CBT)
                courseware or customer presentations. This software has superior graphic imagery,
                computer animation, and motion video which may be combined with high-fidelity sound in
                combination with the text.

                Hypermedia are electronic documents that contain multiple forms of media, including
                text, graphics, video, voice messages, or other units of information such as worksheets.
                In the hypermedia method of information delivery, linkages may be established among
                various items in a large multimedia document. These linkages enable the user to move
                from one topic directly to a related one, instead of scanning the information
                sequentially. Hypertext is a methodology for the construction and interactive use of
                text databases. By definition, hypertext contains only text and a limited amount of
                graphics.

                <li>Personal Information Management</li>

                Personal Information management (PIM) packages are tools that help knowledge workers
                track tasks, people, projects, commitments, and ideas. These packages help end users
                store, organize, and retrieve text and numerical data in the form of notes, lists,
                clippings, tables, memos, letters, reports, and so on.

                <li>Communications Software and Web Browser</li>

                Communications software enables the user to connect to a telecommunications network in
                order to exchange information with other users or systems. The software provides the
                following capabilities:
                <ol>
                    <li>Sending and receiving electronic mail</li>

                    <li>File transfer. You can download a program or a data file from a remote computer to
                        your own workstation or upload a file to the remote computer.</li>

                    <li>Terminal emulation - enabling the personal computer to act as a terminal when
                        required in a particular application.</li>

                    <li>Sending and receiving a fax</li>
                </ol>

                More and more frequently, the reason for connecting to a telecommunications network is
                to gain access to the resources of the Internet. Web browsers are rapidly becoming one
                of the most popular categories of software packages. A browser is a program that enables
                its user to access electronic documents in included in the Internet's World Wide Web, a
                collection of interlinked hypermedia databases distributed among remote sites.

                <li> Programming Languages and their Translators</li>

                Much of the applications software used in an organization needs to be programmed or
                customized. Programming languages are the languages which computer programs are written
                int. A programming language allows a programmer or end user to develop the sets of
                instructions that constitute a computer program. These languages have evolved over four
                generations and can be grouped into five major categories:
                <ol>
                    <li>Machine languages</li>

                    <li>Assembler languages</li>

                    <li>High-level languages</li>

                    <li>Fourth generation languages</li>

                    <li>Object-oriented languages</li>
                </ol>

                <li>Machine Languages:</li>

                Machine languages are the most basic level of programming languages. They were the first
                generation of machine languages.

                <li>Disadvantages of machine languages:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Programs had to be written using binary codes unique to each computer.</li>

                    <li>Programmers had to have a detailed knowledge of the internal operations of the
                        specific type of CPU they were using.</li>

                    <li>Programming was difficult and error-prone</li>

                    <li>Programs are not portable to other computers</li>.
                </ol>



                <li>Assembler Languages:</li>

                Assembler languages are the second generation of machine languages. They were developed
                to reduce the difficulties in writing machine language programs. Assembly language is
                also a low-level language (refers to machine resources, such as registers and memory
                addresses), it is also specific to a computer model or a series of models.

                An assembly language program is translated into a machine language by a simple
                translator called an assembler. Assembly languages are used today only when tight
                control over computer hardware resources is required, such as in certain systems
                programs, particularly those for real-time computing.

                <li>Advantages:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Uses symbolic coded instructions which are easier to remember</li>

                    <li>Programming is simplified as a programmer does not need to know the exact storage
                        location of data and instructions.</li>

                    <li>Efficient use of computer resources is outweighted by the high costs of very tedious
                        systems development and by lock of program portability.
                </ol>

                <li>Disadvantage:</li>

                <li>1. Assembler languages are unique to specific types of computers.</li>

                <li>2. Programs are not portable to other computers.</li>

                <li>High-Level Languages (procedural)</li>

                High-level languages are the third generation programming languages. These languages
                provide statements, each of which is translated into several machine-language
                instructions. High-level languages include COBOL (business application programs), BASIC
                (microcomputer end users), FORTRAN (scientific and engineering applications), and more
                popular today are C, C++, and Visual Basic.

                <li>Advantages:</li>

                1. Easier to learn and understand than an assembler language as instructions
                (statements) that resemble human language or the standard notation of mathematics.

                2. Have less-rigid rules, forms, and syntaxes, so the potential for error is reduced.

                3. Are machine-independent programs therefore programs written in a high-level language
                do not have to be reprogrammed when a new computer is installed.

                4. Programmers do not have to learn a new language for each computer they program.



                <li>Disadvantages:</li>

                1. Less efficient than assembler language programs and require a greater amount of
                computer time for translation into machine instructions.



                <li>Beyond High-Level Programming Languages</li>

                The fourth-generation languages (4GLs) specify what needs to be done rather than
                detailing steps to doing it. 4GLs include a variety of programming languages that are
                more nonprocedural and conversational than prior languages.

                <li>Advantages:</li>

                1. Simplified the programming process.

                2. Use nonprocedural languages that encourage users and programmers to specify the
                results they want, while the computers determines the sequence of instructions that will
                accomplish those results.

                3. Use natural languages that impose no rigid grammatical rules

                <li>Disadvantages:</li>

                1. Less flexible that other languages

                2. Less efficient (in terms of processing speeds and amount of storage capacity needed).

                A number of languages could lay claim to belonging to the fifth generation. The
                following types of programming languages are likely to influence the development of such
                a new paradigm:

                1. Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages tie data elements and the procedures or
                actions that will be performed on them, together into objects. Examples include
                Smalltalk, C++, Visual Basic, Java, Turbo C++, C++, Object C+

                2. Languages that facilitate parallel processing in systems with a large number of
                processors.

                3. Functional languages (such as LISP), based on the mathematical concept of computation
                as an application of functions.

                4. Limited subsets of natural languages which can be processed thanks to the progress in
                artificial intelligence.

                <li>Advantages:</li>

                1. OOP languages are easier to use and more efficient for programming the
                graphics-oriented user interface required by many applications.

                2. Programmed objects are reusable.

                <li>Translators:
                <li>Compilers and Interpreters</li>

                A variety of software packages are available to help programmers develop computer
                programs. For example, programming language translators are programs that translate
                other programs into machine language instruction codes that computers can execute. Other
                software packages called programming tools help programmers write programs by providing
                program creation and editing facilities. Language translator programs (language
                processors) are programs that translate other programs into machine language instruction
                codes the computer can execute. These programs allow you to write your own programs by
                providing program creation and editing facilities.

                Programming language translator programs are known by a variety of names.

                Assembler: translates the symbolic instruction codes of programs written in an assembler
                language into machine language instructions.

                Compiler: translates (compiles) high-level language statements (source programs) to
                machine language programs.

                Interpreter: translates and executes each program statement one at a time, instead of
                first producing a complete machine language program, like compilers and assemblers do.

                <li>Fourth-Generation Languages: (4GL's)</li>

                4GL's include a variety of programming languages that are more nonprocedural and
                conversational than prior languages. The use of fourth-generation languages permits a
                severalfold increase in productivity in information systems development.

                <li>Categories of Fourth-Generation Languages and their Role in End-User Computing</li>

                <li>The distinguishing feature of 4GLs is that they specify what is to be done rather than
                    how to do it. Characteristics of 4GL's include:</li>

                1. The languages are nonprocedural

                2. They do not specify the complete procedure for accomplishing the task (this is filled
                in by the software translator for the 4GL).

                3. About one-tenth of the number of instructions are required in 4GL as compared to
                procedural languages.

                4. Principal categories of 4GLs are query languages, report generators, and application
                generators - Figure

                5. Query languages and report generators make it unnecessary to develop certain
                applications by providing direct access to a database. Application generators make it
                relatively easy to specify in nonprocedural terms a system for such access.

                6. 4GLs also have software generators for producing decision support and executive
                information systems.

                <li>Three categories of 4GLs are:</li>

                1. Query language

                2. Report generators

                3. Application generators

                <li>Query Languages</li>

                Query languages enable end users to access databases directly. Characteristics of query
                language include:

                1. Used online for ad-hoc queries, that is, queries that are not predefined

                2. Result of the query is generally not formatted since it is displayed in a default
                format selected by the system itself.

                3. Interaction is usually simple, only very simple computations are involved.

                4. Most query languages also make it possible to update databases. With many query
                languages, it is possible to request a graphical output to a query.

                <li>Six primary styles for querying a database:</li>

                1. Form fill-in

                2. Menu selection

                3. Command-type query language, such as SQL

                4. Query by example (QBE)

                5. Direct manipulation

                6. Restricted natural language

                <li>Query languages are appropriate for:</li>

                1. Automatic teller machines

                2. Electronic kiosks

                <li>Report Generators</li>

                A report generator enables an end user or an information systems professional to produce
                a report without detailing all the necessary steps, such as formatting the document.

                <li>Characteristics of report generators include:</li>

                1. Offer users greater control over the content and appearance of the output than a
                query language.

                2. Specified data may be retrieved from the specified files or databases, grouped,
                ordered, and summarized in a specified way, and formatted for printing as desired.

                <li>Application Generators</li>

                An application generator makes it possible to specify an entire application, consisting
                of several programs, without much detailed coding. Characteristics of application
                generators include:

                1. Most generators produce (generate) code in a procedural language. This code may then
                be modified to meet the precise needs of the application.

                2. Generators targeted toward end users are simple to use. They are targeted to a
                limited application domain. They produce the code mostly from a specification of the
                structure of files and databases and from the given layouts of screens and reports. The
                requisite processing is specified in terms natural to the end users.

                3. A screen-painting facility makes it possible to specify the graphical user interface
                for the system under development.

                4. Powerful application generators require the expertise of information systems
                professionals, and are general-purpose tools. They often may run on mainframes and
                minicomputers.

                5. Application generators are increasingly integrated into computer-aided software
                engineering (CASE) environments.



                <li>Advantages:</li>

                1. Simplified the programming process.

                2. Use nonprocedural languages that encourage users and programmers to specify the
                results they want, while the computers determines the sequence of instructions that will
                accomplish those results.

                3. Use natural languages that impose no rigid grammatical rules



                <li>Disadvantages:</li>

                1. Less flexible that other languages

                2. Programs written in 4GLs are generally far less efficient during program execution
                that programs in high-level languages. Therefore, their use is limited to projects that
                do not call for such efficiency.



                <li>Object-Oriented Languages</li>

                The idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) is to build programs of software objects,
                in order to tie data elements and the procedures or actions that will be performed on
                them, together into objects. Examples include Smalltalk, C++, Turbo C++, Object C+,
                Java.

                <li>Characteristics of OOP include:</li>

                1. OOP, objects combine (encapsulate) the data with the operations that act on the data.

                2. OOP support class definition and inheritance, creating objects as instances of
                classes, sending messages to the methods in these objects during program execution, and
                other features of OOP.

                3. OOP simplifies design of multimedia systems and of graphical user interfaces.

                <li>Three fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming are:</li>

                1. Objects

                2. Classes

                3. Inheritance

                Objects: are the basic components of which programs are built. In software, a program
                component that models a real-world object by encapsulating data and instructions that
                work with these data.

                Class: is a template from which objects are created. Classes can be defined in a
                hierarchy.

                Inheritance: in object-oriented programming, classes lower in the hierarchy inheriting
                properties (attributes and methods) of the classes higher in it.

                Advantages:

                1. OOP languages are easier to use and more efficient for programming the
                graphics-oriented user interface required by many applications.

                2. Saves much programming, since inheriting properties means programmed objects are
                reusable.

    </li>
    <ul>
        <h5>A project constraint is a definite and inflexible limitation or restriction on a project. All
            constraints are tradeoffs. If you constrain budget, the project may be low quality. If you constrain
            time, you may face risks if the project is rushed. If you constrain risk, the project may be slow
            and expensive. In some cases, the constraints of a project are impossible. It is easy to see this in
            an extreme example such the constraints that a building cost $1 and be completed in one day with no
            risk.
            As constraints restrict project options and can result in severe tradeoffs, they demand careful
            consideration. In most cases, constraints are driven by absolute business necessity. The following
            is a list of common project constraints.
            <li>Business</li>
            Business constraints include anything that the business can't change that affects a project. For
            example, a business may have commitments to partners, customers or regulators.
